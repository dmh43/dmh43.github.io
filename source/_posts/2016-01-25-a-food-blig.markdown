# A Food Blog or Something
So I've been toying with the idea of starting a blog for a while now
but didn't really get excited about it until today. I want to share my
thoughts and experiences with cooking, science things and harmonica playing,
all in one place. My general thoughts on those things:
* Food is OK but cooking is just sorcery
* [I'm an engineer, I swear. Textbooks suck and high voltage gets me excited.](https://xkcd.com/435/) **or nah?**
* [Harp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EK40FMGvDw&index=99&list=LLzcbkrR1jGBNWl1KU_ajDqw) is the sound of a winged Dick Dawkins weeping over the [Weasel Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_program)

Oh --, and of course, since I'm a literal degenerate,
I plan to have each entry be a GitHub [Gist](https://gist.github.com/)
made pretty by [RoughDraft.io](http://www.roughdraft.io/).

To see all my gists: <http://dmh43.roughdraft.io/>
